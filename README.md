In this roguelike, an entity entitled Dungeon Master, with no friends for playing RPG, kidnaps and obligate a Slime to play his horrible concept of an RPG Campaign.
To be set free the slime has to end the campaign, while being forced to die over and over in the hands of others kidnapped creatures, without being allowed to change his class or weapon.

Get new items, survive through 3 different stages, fight different NPC's, and defeat the same Dungeon Boss 3 times in the worst RPG system of all: S&S, Slimes and Shields.(The budget was low, so DM kidnapped just one boss, and told him to go easy the first times).

The DM has plenty of time for improving the system and let him change the shield for another weapon, since this campaign will take 900 years to finish...
