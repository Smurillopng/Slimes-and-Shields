  - Ok, enough waiting. Welcome to my RPG campaign. The Shielder Slime Campaing,
    working name.
  - I am the Dungeon Master and I kidnapped each one of you to be my friends and
    play with me. I praise for showing the best session you ever played.
  - 'Each time you enter a room, I will throw a dice for deciding which enemy or
    item you will get. There are always one item per dungeon and one portal. '
  - ' I always decide the dice number in my system.'
  - Now lets have fun. After the campaign comes to an end everyone can go back home.
    This will last for 900 years, but don't worry... You guys can't die here.
  - One more thing, I draw the commands for you on the floor. In case you don't know
    how to read... And don't fall from the map, low budget.
